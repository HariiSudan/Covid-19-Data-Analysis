# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

![COVID-19](link-to-your-image-file.png)

## Description

This repository contains my data analysis project on COVID-19 data. The dataset used in this analysis includes information on daily COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, travel history, province, and city. The data covers a specific time range and provides insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning:** The raw data was processed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I performed EDA to gain a better understanding of the data. Visualizations were created to explore trends, identify hotspots, and understand the distribution of cases, deaths, and recoveries.

3. **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraging the geographic information in the dataset, I mapped the spread of COVID-19 at the regional and city levels to identify regions most affected.

4. **Time Series Analysis:** I analyzed the time series data to observe patterns, seasonality, and changes in the rate of infections, recoveries, and fatalities over time.

5. **Correlation and Regression:** I explored correlations between various factors such as travel history, population density, and COVID-19 cases. Additionally, regression analysis was performed to predict future trends.

## Findings

The analysis revealed critical insights into the impact of travel history on the spread of COVID-19. Regions with higher population densities showed higher infection rates. The study also highlighted the effectiveness of public health interventions in controlling the spread.
