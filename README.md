# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
This repository contains my data analysis project on COVID-19 data. The dataset used in this analysis includes information on daily COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, travel history, province, and city. The data covers a specific time range and provides insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic.
